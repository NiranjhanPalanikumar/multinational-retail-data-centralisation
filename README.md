# Multinational-Retail-Data-Centralisation

In this project we perform data analytics on sales data of an organisation. The data is spread across many different data sources AWS RDS, RESTful API, JSON, and CSV files making it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team. In an effort to become more data-driven, we would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location. 

The data was collected from the various sources and transformed using pandas and transformed to a STAR schema database for easy storage and perform sub-millisecond queries.
